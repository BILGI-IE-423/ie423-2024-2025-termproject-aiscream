# Beneath the Surface: Quiet Factors in Student Success

# Abstract

This research project investigates the extent to which student academic performance can be shaped by factors beyond their control—such as family background, home environment, and socioeconomic context. Using machine learning models trained on features including parental involvement, household income, and access to educational resources, the study explores how these elements relate to academic outcomes. The core aim is to help educators better understand which students may be at risk of falling behind—not because of effort or motivation, but due to structural disadvantages at home that are often invisible in the classroom. By identifying these patterns, the study seeks to inform practical, empathy-driven approaches that allow teachers to offer timely and appropriate support to students who may otherwise go unnoticed.

# Scope of the Project

The project focuses on analyzing uncontrollable variables that can influence a student's academic success. These include factors such as Parental Education Level, Family Income, Distance from Home, Family Size, Parental Jobs, and Support at Home. Rather than aiming for broad or general conclusions about what affects academic performance, this study concentrates on:
* Understanding how much these background factors contribute to students doing well or poorly in school.
* Exploring which specific home-related features are most strongly linked to academic difficulty.
* Providing teachers with insight that could help them recognize students in need of extra attention, even before academic struggles become visible.
This perspective is particularly valuable in contexts where teachers may not have detailed knowledge of students' home lives, yet are expected to meet their learning needs fairly and effectively.

# Research Questions 

This study is guided by the central question: How much of a student’s success is shaped by factors outside their control? To explore this, we ask:
- **RQ1: Are student outcomes significantly affected by uncontrollable background variables?**  
  _This question helps us understand whether external circumstances have a noticeable pattern in academic outcomes._


- **RQ2: Which uncontrollable factors are most consistently linked with above- or below-average performance?**  
  _We aim to highlight which home or background-related features may be warning signs of academic risk._

- **RQ3: Is it possible to flag potentially at-risk students early on, using only background data—before their grades begin to drop?**
  _This could help teachers and schools provide timely, targeted support to students who may be silently struggling._
  
By focusing on what students bring with them to the classroom—before they even open a textbook—this project hopes to support more informed, sensitive, and proactive educational practices.
